If you have a VDO Dayton MS5000 navigation system in your car, you might want to update it with the latest maps of Europe. This way, you can enjoy the most accurate and up-to-date routes, points of interest, and traffic information. Here are the steps to update your VDO Dayton MS5000 navigation system with the latest Europe maps:
 
1. Find out which map set is compatible with your system. There are four different map sets available for VDO Dayton navigation systems: CD set for non-Supercode systems, CD set for Supercode systems, SD card for PC 5200 and MS 5200, and DVD for MS 5700 and PC 5700 systems[^1^]. The MS5000 system uses the CD set for Supercode systems[^3^]. You can check if your system is Supercode by looking at the serial number on the bottom of the unit. If it starts with "SC", it is Supercode.
2. Order the map set online from a reputable seller. You can find various sellers online that offer the VDO Dayton Europe map set (10 CDs) 2014/2015 for Supercode systems[^1^] [^2^]. Make sure you order from a trusted seller that provides genuine Tom Tom navigation maps and complimentary firmware updates.
3. Insert the first CD into your system and follow the instructions on the screen. The first CD contains the firmware update and the major roads of Europe. The firmware update will improve the performance and functionality of your system. The major roads of Europe will allow you to navigate across countries without changing CDs.
4. Insert the other CDs as needed to access detailed maps of specific regions. The other nine CDs contain detailed maps of different regions of Europe, such as Benelux, France, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, Spain, etc. You can insert them when you need to navigate within those regions.
5. Enjoy your updated VDO Dayton MS5000 navigation system with the latest Europe maps. You can now drive with confidence and convenience across Europe with your VDO Dayton MS5000 navigation system. You can also benefit from features such as speed camera alerts, lane guidance, voice guidance, and more.
